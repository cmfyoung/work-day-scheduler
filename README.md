# work-day-scheduler description 
Created a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of a typical working day (9amâ€“5pm) by modifying starter code. 
This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. Used Day.js library to work with date and time.
