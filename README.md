# work-day-scheduler description 
Created a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of a typical working day (9am–5pm) by modifying starter code. 
This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. Used Day.js library to work with date and time.
